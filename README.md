HI JEREMY
Value Proposition: HubLyfe is a one-stop database to easily find all the transportation, education, salary, cost of living (rent), and lifestyle data about Boston neighborhoods for persons new to the city (a very confusing city) who are unhappy with the generic and vague Zillow and Craigslist searches which do not give you all of the necessary information to truly maximize what you get based on your means of living.
